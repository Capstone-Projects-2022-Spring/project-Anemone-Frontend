# project-Anemone-Frontend
This will contain all the files that control the frontend/interface of project Anemone and was intended to interact with its [API](https://anemone.avalonbloom.com/api)

## Want to try out the application
Access our [React App](https://anemone.avalonbloom.com/)


## Available Scripts
In `anemone-app`, you can run:
```
npm start
``` 
The command runs the app in the development mode.
To open navigate to: `http://localhost:3000` to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Testing Features
```
npm test
```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See [TESTING.md]() about running tests for more information.

```
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Known Bugs
- The UI was an extra deliverable for Electric Blue Fish Productions, therefore all components are in a draft status. 
- There is no full flushed out data flow.
- Some components such as `Search<-Search Bar<-dummy-data-metadata`, `Register<-Verify`, and `Upload` function in isolated fashions.
- Retrieve->Search does not function.
- All top left buttons on the Search Page are not functional.
- Regster and Login pages do not redirect the user to the home state of the application
